 Interface and Inner class
 
 Interface
 
 /* --------------------------------------- | what is an interface | -----------------------------------------------*/
  
 An interface is like an abstract class, meaning that it contains methods which require modification when
 inherited by the class using the 'implements' keyword.
 
 The sole purpose of an interface is to be a place a placeholder for undefined methods, which will later be defined 
 when inherited. It can only hold undefined methods and constant variable.
 
 An interface is a NOT a class, but it can be a data-type for variables
 	
 An interface a is place which only contains method heading, meaning just the first and top line of the heading, 
 and not body{} i.e public int powerf(int q, int m).

 ::Note::
 
 When an interface is connected to a class via implements i.e. public class Examp implements PowerInterface; 
 this force the Examp class to inherit and add the method into the child class
 
 An interface can extend and other interface, but not classed.
